I am a Ph.D student at UConn working under the supervision of [Dorit Bar-on](https://www.doritbar-on.com/). My research interests include philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and philosophy of language. My current research focuses on theory of mind in non-human animals and infants and the evolutionary relationship between language and theory of mind. My secondary interests include political epistemology and the role of science in public policy.
